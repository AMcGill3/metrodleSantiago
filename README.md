# üöä Metrodle Santiago
A guessing game based on an [original game](www.metrodle.com) involving the London tube. The creators of this game very kindly granted me permission to make this, which I was inspired to do when I was living in Chile and missed (for whatever reason) the tube at home, so I would play the original game. The game is written in Spanish given its target market, for which I owe thanks to my friend Sebastian √Åvila who verified my translations.

## About the Game
![Screenshot of the main page of the game on a mobile screen.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd3101e-77fc-4c52-9b6f-70119d23c4ef)
You are presented with a section of the map of the Santiago metro in Chile. You have six chances to guess the correct station, with each guess telling you how far you are from the target station and whether or not you are on the correct line/s. Once the game has finished, you can share how you did with a message saying how many guesses it took you and how far each was. You can see also see your total stats, with how many games you've won and in how many guesses, as well as your winning streak and max streak.

## Features I Would Like to Introduce in the Future
* A leaderboard to compare your stats with other users
* The new lines planned for the metro in the coming years. I would add these maybe a month or two after their introduction to give people time to gain a knowledge of them because of course they won't know the lines so well the day they're opened.

Again, with the permission of the creators of the original game, I'd love to replicate this game with another city, such as New York or Paris, but with a python backend and typescript frontend as opposed to Node and Javascript respectively, which I used for this project, to develop my skills further.
